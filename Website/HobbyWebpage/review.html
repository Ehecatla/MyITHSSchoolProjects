              <p>There are many online games nowdays but when World of Warcraft(Wow) came at 2004 there weren't many of them and they were not as popular as nowdays. This nowdays known as largest online game with great base of players had no different beginning than any other - just average popularity. There is much more to be said about this game but this is all just a place holder, so maybe some other time. Many critics has reviewed World of Warcraft as fantastic albeit not too original game.</p>
